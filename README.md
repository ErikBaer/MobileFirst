# MobileFirst

This is a simple landing-page with responsive Layout.

It is developed with an Mobile First approach, first developing the mobile-version
before making it responsive and suitable for desktop afterwards.
The layout provides a clean implementation of CSS-Grid for several use-cases. 

The code for this homepage was written as part of a course from TraversyMedia.
